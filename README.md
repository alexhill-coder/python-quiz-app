# Quiz App

A quiz app created in Python. It is a simple right or wrong quiz app that retrieves 10 questions from an online database and provides the user a final score. 
It also provides feedback to let the user know whether they are correct and that the quiz has ended.  

## How to Use

The file is written in standard Python that uses three modules: 
- tkinter
- html
- requests

Two of these modules should be included with the standard Python libraries, the requests module will need to be installed. The information for this module can be found [here.](https://realpython.com/python-requests/)

File descriptions:

- Main - calls the functions of the app. 
- data - retrieves the information from the website 
- question_model - helps formats the retrieved questions.
- quiz_brain - Checks the answers and stores the information
- ui - Creates and adjusts the ui of the app.
